  mpc-ceremony [--format human|json] [--quiet] <command> [flags]

Offline, append-only orchestration for this repository's BLS12-381 Groth16
multi-party setup. The binary accepts setup artifacts and signing keys only.
It performs no network access and never selects a mutable "latest" artifact.

All input and output paths are explicit. Outputs must not already exist. There
are no network, automatic-discovery, overwrite, deterministic-randomness, or
verification-bypass flags.

`

var inspectHelp = `Usage:
  mpc-ceremony inspect --ceremony FILE --ceremony-signature FILE \
    --coordinator-public-key-file KEY --transcript-dir DIR [--full]

Read-only recovery inspection. Reports ceremony identity and mode, per-phase
accepted count and head record, the next scheduled participant and index, the
closure/beacon/seal state, and which referenced artifacts are present.

It requires no signing key, writes nothing, and never replays contributions.
Unlike every other command it discovers the highest published chain file per
phase; that is safe only because the result feeds no signing or verification
decision, and every discovered file is authenticated against the trust anchor
before being reported.

The default depth verifies signatures and structure and checks artifact
presence by size in seconds. --full additionally re-verifies every payload
digest, attestation, erasure, and verification record, which re-hashes every
artifact. The output states which depth ran.
`

const replayFlagsHelp = `
Required immutable replay evidence:
  --transcript-root DIR
  --phase1-chain FILE --phase1-chain-signature FILE
  --phase1-close FILE --phase1-close-signature FILE
  --phase1-beacon FILE --phase1-beacon-signature FILE
  --phase1-seal FILE --phase1-seal-signature FILE
  --phase2-chain FILE --phase2-chain-signature FILE
  --phase2-close FILE --phase2-close-signature FILE
  --phase2-beacon FILE --phase2-beacon-signature FILE

The signed chain, closure, beacon, and seal records bind the genesis,
contributions, attestations, erasure evidence, verification records, raw drand
responses, and commons by safe relative artifact name. Those artifacts are
strictly resolved beneath --transcript-root; the operator cannot substitute a
second path list.
`

var commandHelp = map[string]string{
	"inspect": inspectHelp,
	"init": `Usage:
  mpc-ceremony init --key-version ownership-destination-v2 \
    --participants ROSTER.json --policy POLICY.json \
    --coordinator-key-id ID --coordinator-signing-key KEY \
    --created-at RFC3339 --out-dir DIR [--mode rehearsal|production] \
    [--session-nonce-hex HEX]

Compiles a registered repository circuit and writes a fresh signed ceremony
definition. The authoritative ceremony ID is derived from canonical content,
including a 32-byte session nonce securely generated when omitted. Production
mode requires an exact clean source build.
`,
	"phase1": `Usage:
  mpc-ceremony phase1 <contribute|attest-erasure|verify|close|beacon|seal> [flags]

Phase 1 is sequential and append-only. Contributors and coordinators must name
the exact accepted chain; the command never discovers a "latest" state.
`,
	"phase1 contribute": `Usage:
  mpc-ceremony phase1 contribute --ceremony FILE \
    --ceremony-signature FILE --coordinator-public-key-file KEY \
    --transcript-dir DIR --chain FILE --chain-signature FILE \
    --participant-id ID --participant-signing-key KEY \
    --environment FILE --contributed-at RFC3339 --out-dir FRESH_DIR

Replays the complete accepted phase 1 chain before adding OS-generated
randomness. The input chain is never modified.
`,
	"phase1 attest-erasure": `Usage:
  mpc-ceremony phase1 attest-erasure --ceremony FILE \
    --ceremony-signature FILE --coordinator-public-key-file KEY \
    --participant-id ID --participant-signing-key KEY \
    --candidate-dir DIR --destroyed-at RFC3339

Writes erasure.json and its participant signature into the candidate directory
without replacing existing files. This is an operational attestation, not
technical or cryptographic proof that contribution randomness was erased.
`,
	"phase1 verify": `Usage:
  mpc-ceremony phase1 verify --ceremony FILE --ceremony-signature FILE \
    --coordinator-public-key-file KEY --transcript-dir DIR --chain FILE \
    --chain-signature FILE --candidate-dir DIR \
    --coordinator-signing-key KEY --accepted-at RFC3339

Authenticates the signed chain and candidate evidence, verifies the candidate
transition directly from the accepted native head, then appends immutable
numbered artifacts and a new signed chain record. Participant contribution and
phase close perform the independent full-prefix replays.
`,
	"phase1 close": `Usage:
  mpc-ceremony phase1 close --ceremony FILE --ceremony-signature FILE \
    --coordinator-public-key-file KEY --transcript-dir DIR --chain FILE \
    --chain-signature FILE --coordinator-signing-key KEY \
    --beacon-round N | --beacon-round-lead SECONDS

Replays the full phase, derives the exact Quicknet schedule from the round,
samples closed_at inside the core after replay, and atomically publishes the
signed closure only while the policy lead still holds.

At K=21 the replay takes hours, so --beacon-round asks you to predict it: a
round named too near is already public when the closure is written and the
whole replay is discarded. --beacon-round-lead instead derives the round from
the clock sampled after the replay, at least SECONDS ahead and never below the
signed witness lead. The round is not published or observable until the closure
record is written either way, so deriving it later commits to nothing sooner.
`,
	"phase1 beacon": `Usage:
  mpc-ceremony phase1 beacon --ceremony FILE --ceremony-signature FILE \
    --coordinator-public-key-file KEY --closure FILE \
    --closure-signature FILE --raw-response FILE --published-at RFC3339 \
    --coordinator-signing-key KEY --transcript-dir DIR

Cryptographically verifies an archived pinned drand quicknet response and
derives the protocol challenge from its signature. The command performs no
network fetch and accepts neither randomness nor a challenge from the operator.
`,
	"phase1 seal": `Usage:
  mpc-ceremony phase1 seal --ceremony FILE --ceremony-signature FILE \
    --coordinator-public-key-file KEY --transcript-dir DIR --closure FILE \
    --closure-signature FILE --beacon FILE --beacon-signature FILE \
    --coordinator-signing-key KEY --out-dir FRESH_DIR

The beacon is supplied as offline evidence and must satisfy the signed policy
and postdate the signed closure.
`,
	"phase2": `Usage:
  mpc-ceremony phase2 <init|contribute|attest-erasure|verify|close|beacon> [flags]

Phase 2 is bound to the exact compiled R1CS and verified phase 1 seal.

    --ceremony-signature FILE --coordinator-public-key-file KEY \
    --participant-id ID --participant-signing-key KEY \
    --candidate-dir DIR --destroyed-at RFC3339

Signs the participant's Phase 2 environment-destruction attestation. The
statement is auditable evidence, not proof that secret randomness was erased.
`,
	"phase2 verify": `Usage:
  mpc-ceremony phase2 verify --ceremony FILE --ceremony-signature FILE \
    --coordinator-public-key-file KEY --phase1-seal FILE \
  --phase1-seal-signature FILE --transcript-dir DIR --chain FILE \
  --chain-signature FILE --candidate-dir DIR \
  --coordinator-signing-key KEY --accepted-at RFC3339

Authenticates the signed chain, Phase 1 seal, and candidate evidence; verifies
the candidate transition directly from the accepted native Phase 2 head; then
appends immutable numbered artifacts and a new signed chain record.
Participant contribution and phase close retain independent full replays.
`,
	"phase2 close": `Usage:
  mpc-ceremony phase2 close --ceremony FILE --ceremony-signature FILE \
    --coordinator-public-key-file KEY --phase1-seal FILE \
    --phase1-seal-signature FILE --transcript-dir DIR --chain FILE \
    --chain-signature FILE --coordinator-signing-key KEY \
    --beacon-round N | --beacon-round-lead SECONDS

Replays the full phase, derives the exact Quicknet schedule from the round,
samples closed_at inside the core after replay, and atomically publishes the
signed closure only while the policy lead still holds.

At K=21 the replay takes hours, so --beacon-round asks you to predict it: a
round named too near is already public when the closure is written and the
whole replay is discarded. --beacon-round-lead instead derives the round from
the clock sampled after the replay, at least SECONDS ahead and never below the
signed witness lead. The round is not published or observable until the closure
record is written either way, so deriving it later commits to nothing sooner.
`,
	"phase2 beacon": `Usage:

    --coordinator-public-key-file KEY --closure FILE \
    --closure-signature FILE --raw-response FILE --published-at RFC3339 \
    --coordinator-signing-key KEY --transcript-dir DIR

Records the distinct Phase 2 post-closure beacon evidence used by finalize.
`,
	"finalize": `Usage:
  mpc-ceremony finalize prepare [FLAGS]
  mpc-ceremony finalize complete [FLAGS]
`,
	"finalize prepare": `Usage:
  mpc-ceremony finalize prepare --ceremony FILE --ceremony-signature FILE \

    --coordinator-signing-key KEY --prepared-at RFC3339_UTC \
    --out-dir FRESH_DIR
` + replayFlagsHelp + `

Independently compiles this repository's destination-v2 R1CS, replays both
phases, and publishes a coordinator-signed preliminary native PK/VK tree. It
is not a candidate and cannot be audited or released.
`,
	"finalize complete": `Usage:
  mpc-ceremony finalize complete --ceremony FILE --ceremony-signature FILE \
    --coordinator-public-key-file KEY [REPLAY EVIDENCE FLAGS] \
    --coordinator-signing-key KEY --public-evidence FILE \
    --finalized-at RFC3339_UTC --out-dir FRESH_DIR
` + replayFlagsHelp + `

Replays both phases again, verifies the canonical external public proof
against the replayed final VK, and creates the coordinator-signed but
unsigned-for-release candidate. It accepts only the public evidence artifact.
Release signing remains a separate post-audit step.
`,
	"audit": `Usage:
  mpc-ceremony audit --ceremony FILE \
    --ceremony-signature FILE --coordinator-public-key-file KEY \
    [REPLAY EVIDENCE FLAGS] --candidate-bundle DIR \
    --auditor-id ID --auditor-signing-key KEY --audited-at RFC3339_UTC \
    --out FRESH_FILE --audit-signature FRESH_FILE
` + replayFlagsHelp + `

Audit always independently compiles the circuit and performs the full
two-phase replay. It emits a signed passing record only after reproducing the
candidate's native keys, Cardano export, and coherence evidence.
`,
	"release": `Usage:
  mpc-ceremony release <sign|verify> [flags]

Release authenticity is separate from MPC contribution identity.
`,
	"release sign": `Usage:
  mpc-ceremony release sign --ceremony FILE --ceremony-signature FILE \
    --coordinator-public-key-file KEY --candidate-bundle DIR \
	    --audit-report FILE --audit-signature FILE \
	    --audit-report FILE --audit-signature FILE \

	    --release-signing-key KEY --signature-key-id ID \
    --released-at RFC3339_UTC --release-dir FRESH_DIR

	Requires at least two distinct enrolled auditors plus the coordinator-signed
	Phase 1 and Phase 2 operational bundle. Each phase must contain a valid public
	witness quorum and matching multi-relay beacon responses. The candidate is
	never mutated; all verified evidence is atomically published into a fresh
	release directory.
`,
	"release verify": `Usage:
  mpc-ceremony release verify --ceremony FILE --ceremony-signature FILE \
    --coordinator-public-key-file KEY --keys-dir DIR \
    --manifest-public-key-file KEY --signature-key-id ID

Authenticates the release using the out-of-band release public key, then
strictly verifies the bundled audit evidence, transcript, native keys, Cardano
export, candidate signature, and checksums.
`,
	"decision": `Usage:
  mpc-ceremony decision <prepare|sign|verify> [flags]

Production decisions are canonical content-addressed records. The command
never fetches evidence URIs and never infers independence, host integrity,
entropy quality, erasure, public witnessing, mirrors, or attendance.
`,
	"decision prepare": `Usage:
  mpc-ceremony decision prepare --ceremony FILE --ceremony-signature FILE \
    --coordinator-public-key-file KEY --draft FILE --out FRESH_FILE

Strictly parses a proof-tool-mpc-production-decision-draft-v1 record, derives
the release_id and decision_id, and checks ceremony, source, exact K=21
circuit, and signer-role bindings. The fresh output is the only byte string
the accountable roles should sign.
`,
	"decision sign": `Usage:
  mpc-ceremony decision sign --ceremony FILE --ceremony-signature FILE \
    --coordinator-public-key-file KEY --decision FILE \
    --evidence-root DIR \
    --role coordinator|auditor|release_signer --signer-id ID \
    --signing-key KEY --out FRESH_FILE

Signs the exact canonical decision bytes with one enrolled ceremony identity.
A GO record requires the coordinator, the two auditors named by the record,
and the distinct release signer to sign the same bytes. Before loading a GO
signing key, the command hashes and semantically verifies the full local
evidence set. Evidence verification is optional for a NO-GO record so an
accountable role can sign a fail-closed decision that reports unavailable
evidence.
`,
	"decision verify": `Usage:
  mpc-ceremony decision verify --ceremony FILE --ceremony-signature FILE \
    --coordinator-public-key-file KEY --decision FILE \
    --signature FILE --signature FILE --signature FILE --signature FILE \
    --evidence-root DIR

Strictly parses the record and detached role signatures, hashes every local
evidence artifact, checks release/candidate/transcript/operational/audit
coherence, and fail-closes GO unless all gates PASS and all four roles signed.
Evidence URIs are content bindings only; the command performs no network fetch.
`,
	"ops": `Usage:
  mpc-ceremony ops <export-signing|import-signature|verify> [flags]

Operational records cover proof-of-possession enrollment, transfers and
receipts, immutable mirrors, pre-beacon public witnesses, multi-operator relay
evidence, governance events, and the release-bound operational evidence bundle.
`,
	"ops export-signing": `Usage:
  mpc-ceremony ops export-signing --record-type TYPE --record FILE \
    --ceremony FILE --ceremony-signature FILE \
    --coordinator-public-key-file KEY --out-dir FRESH_DIR

Strictly verifies the canonical record and ceremony binding, then exports
canonical.json and signing-request.json. No private signing key is read.
`,
	"ops import-signature": `Usage:
  mpc-ceremony ops import-signature --record-type TYPE --canonical FILE \
    --ceremony FILE --ceremony-signature FILE \
    --coordinator-public-key-file KEY --signer-public-key-file KEY \
    --raw-signature FILE --out FRESH_FILE

Accepts 64 raw signature bytes or 128 lowercase hex characters, verifies the
offline Ed25519 signature over exact canonical bytes and signer identity, then
writes the repository detached-signature format without replacement.
`,
	"ops verify": `Usage:
  mpc-ceremony ops verify --record-type TYPE --record FILE --signature FILE \
    --ceremony FILE --ceremony-signature FILE \
    --coordinator-public-key-file KEY --signer-public-key-file KEY \
    [--related-record HANDOFF] [--evidence-root DIR]

Authenticates canonical bytes, immutable ceremony fields, enrolled signer, and
detached signature. Receipt verification requires the exact related handoff.
Evidence-bundle verification requires the complete local evidence root and
validates both authenticated chains, every custody transfer, independent
mirrors and public witnesses, and three distinct beacon relay operators.
