# gnark v0.16.3 Security Migration

Date: 2026-08-27

## Security reason

The repository previously used gnark v0.15.0. That release is affected by
[GHSA-3mvx-pp85-pm65](https://github.com/Consensys/gnark/security/advisories/GHSA-3mvx-pp85-pm65),
a critical under-constrained-hint issue that can permit false proofs. The
ownership circuits directly use the affected `std/math/emulated` and
`std/math/uints` packages. gnark v0.16.2 is the first fixed release; this
migration uses the current v0.16.3 release and gnark-crypto v0.21.0.

The old proving and verifying keys are retired. A verifier built for the old
constraint system remains unsafe even when its surrounding application is
rebuilt against a fixed gnark library.

## Regression evidence

`TestGHSA3mvxPackedKeyCollisionIsRejected` encodes the advisory's packed-key
collision against the uint lookup chain. It fails against the old v0.15.0
vendor tree because the forged witness is accepted, and passes against the
v0.16.3 vendor tree because the forged intermediate is range checked.

The local `uints-constant-fold.patch` was rebased so compile-time constant
operations remain folded while every dynamic lookup result retains upstream's
new 8-bit range check. `scripts/check-vendor-drift.sh` verifies that the vendor
tree is a clean v0.16.3 vendor operation plus the reviewed patch series.

Key-bundle loaders, the browser WASM preflight, and key/chunk-manifest
coherence checks all require the exact `v0.16.3` version. Negative tests reject
an otherwise coherent manifest that claims the retired v0.15.0 version.

## Circuit identities and size

The public statements and domain separators are unchanged. Circuit and key
identities are bumped so fixed proofs cannot be confused with proofs for an old
constraint system.

| Profile | Old identity | Fixed identity | Old constraints | Fixed constraints | Domain |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Ownership | `ownership-v1` | `ownership-v2` | 1,789,634 | 2,413,291 | K22 |
| Ownership + destination | `ownership-destination-v2` | `ownership-destination-v3` | 1,789,750 | 2,413,407 | K22 |
| Multi, count 2 | `ownership-multi-destination-v1-count2` | `ownership-multi-destination-v2-count2` | 3,447,616 | 4,694,932 | K23 |

The destination circuit grows by 623,657 constraints (34.85%). The increase is
the expected cost of constraining dynamic lookup outputs that the affected
version left under-constrained.

## Fresh Preprod setup evidence

A fresh single-operator Preprod setup was generated from clean source commit
`9e8cab701589cf77c1c8d74fa016d8b13faebd84`. This is not an MPC or trustless
ceremony: the operator explicitly acknowledged the toxic-waste boundary. The
signed key manifest verifies against its external trust anchor and pins:

- native VK hash
  `blake2b256:ebf91d8ffc17fab6d26afdee256798f7178ed010200001285468688f97abc514`;
- Cardano VK hash
  `blake2b256:4dfe550735d4f27a02e58de8a5567aee5aed66279cd4222b026d8059b18615da`;
- CCS hash
  `blake2b256:39bb5adabc2aec214c69f925578546c5e922d15b1104d03d290c57fcda371a80`;
- setup transcript hash
  `blake2b256:42996b1b070d2313e235de71001f58e3f3dbb31bc33dc3a1ac8c4fe9edd23740`.

The native PK is 1,834,843,511 bytes and the frozen CCS is 161,214,609
bytes. The local browser candidate splits the PK into 875 signed 2 MiB chunks
and compresses the CCS transport to 43,806,673 bytes while retaining both
identity and compressed-content hashes.

## Performance evidence

The native pre-migration baseline used the frozen v0.15.0 destination CCS and
key bundle on an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D with Go 1.26.5. Five real proofs all
verified. Proving times were 4,011.493 ms, 3,610.577 ms, 3,811.809 ms,
3,872.431 ms, and 4,094.230 ms; median 3,872.431 ms. Peak process RSS was
4,925,220 KiB.

The fixed v0.16.3 destination bundle used the same host and Go version. Five
real proofs all verified. Proving times were 5,372.055 ms, 5,037.937 ms,
4,880.453 ms, 4,878.902 ms, and 4,966.319 ms; median 4,966.319 ms. Peak process
RSS was 7,663,944 KiB.

| Measurement | v0.15.0 | v0.16.3 | Change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Median native prove | 3,872.431 ms | 4,966.319 ms | +28.25% |
| Peak native RSS | 4,925,220 KiB | 7,663,944 KiB | +55.61% |
| Proving key size | 1,288,707,133 bytes | 1,834,843,511 bytes | +42.38% |
| Constraint system size | 129,221,468 bytes | 161,214,609 bytes | +24.76% |
| Proving key load | 9,772.896 ms | 22,959.641 ms | +134.93% |

The browser runtime was built twice from clean inputs; the proof WASM,
MSM-worker WASM, and `wasm_exec.js` were byte-identical between builds. A cold
loopback Playwright run then loaded the signed manifest, 2 MiB PK chunks,
compressed CCS, VK, and deployment descriptor, generated a real proof, and
verified it locally. On an intentionally bounded four-worker/eight-CPU run it
took 158.786 seconds, reported 2.154 GiB peak Go heap, completed all 56 worker
shards, and used no swap.

Twenty fresh Cardano-format proofs were generated and verified natively before
serialization. The Plutus verifier suite then passed all 137 tests, including
ordinary, all-distinct, repeated-proof, malformed-proof, wrong-public-input,
reordering, substitution, and compiled-validator cases.

## Rollout invariant

The fixed constraint system, PK, VK, Cardano VK serialization, proof fixtures,
contract parameters, browser runtime, chunk manifest, deployment manifest, and
desktop pins form one coherence set. The new R2 release must use a new immutable
prefix. Old preprod objects must not be removed until a new preprod verifier is
deployed and every active manifest points at the fixed VK; replacing only the
PK/CCS would break proving or leave the old verifier relation active.

The legacy embedded ownership-v1 verifier is fail-closed during this migration.
It must not be re-enabled until an ownership-v2 key is generated and pinned.

## Tiny rehearsal circuit serialization check

Locally compiled the unchanged `rehearsal-tiny-v1` circuit with the prior fork's
vendored gnark 0.15.0 and the migration's vendored gnark 0.16.3. Both serialized
constraint systems are 1046 bytes, five constraints, domain eight, one commitment.
The old SHA-256 is
`1cbaefe7d52545efae5a9033f6fd381b667ec305da58fb84065a79438c5161ab`;
the new SHA-256 is
`177ab88ee828ca78f753d7e63342d5c86f3ba4ef19910ad4182d2d648b539519`.
Only zero-based offsets 16, 24, 573, and 575 differ: the binary minor/patch
version header and the embedded `GnarkVersion` string. All other bytes match.
The rehearsal evidence helper pins the new exact serialization. This comparison
is specific to the tiny test circuit; it does not establish production-circuit
security or compatibility of previously generated keys.

## Validation waiver for this migration

The maintainer explicitly waived the repository's live Preprod Lace claim-flow
requirement in the review conversation. No live wallet transaction is claimed as
tested. This waiver applies to this migration; the repository's general policy
remains unchanged. Other applicable automated validation remains required.
