# MPC Ceremony Parallel Optimizations

This note explains the three multithreading optimizations applied to gnark's
BLS12-381 Groth16 MPC implementation for the proof-tool ceremony. They change
how independent work is scheduled; they do not change the circuit, proof
statement, elliptic-curve formulas, transcript layout, or verification rules.

The implementation is carried as reviewed patches against the repository's
pinned gnark v0.15.0 dependency:

- `experiments/wasm-prover/patches/mpc-phase1-parallel-update.patch`
- `experiments/wasm-prover/patches/mpc-phase1-parallel-codec.patch`
- `experiments/wasm-prover/patches/mpc-phase2-parallel-initialize.patch`

`scripts/bootstrap-vendor.sh` applies these patches when reconstructing the
gitignored `vendor/` tree. Vendor drift checks, release metadata, and SBOM
generation include all three patches.

## Results Summary

Controlled benchmarks were run on a 16-vCPU AMD EPYC host. The benchmark
fixtures use smaller domains than the complete ceremony, so these figures are
component measurements rather than end-to-end K=21 predictions.

| Hot path | Serial median | Parallel median | Speedup |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Phase 1 point update | 574 ms | 50.8 ms | 11.3× |
| Phase 1 encoding | 8.01 ms | 1.79 ms | 4.5× |
| Phase 1 decoding | 1.33 s | 151 ms | 8.9× |
| Phase 2 initialization | 9.97 s | 1.14 s | 8.7× |

The first result from the exact K=21 comparison rehearsal is:

| Exact K=21 stage | Previous run | Optimized run | Speedup |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Ceremony initialization | 12m16s | 1m34.76s | 7.8× |
| Phase 1 contribution (16 vCPU) | 56m54s | 7m02s | 8.1× |
| Phase 1 contribution (8 vCPU) | 56m54s | 8m01s | 7.1× |
| Candidate verification (accept) | 50m27s | 5m46s | 8.7× |

The optimized initialization averaged 954% CPU according to GNU `time`, which
means it used about 9.54 CPU cores concurrently. It reached a peak resident set
size of approximately 3.38 GiB.

The contribution and verification rows were measured on 2026-08-20 during a
Relay-driven production-mode first-head test at the canonical circuit
(1,789,750 constraints): the 16-vCPU contribution ran on the same EPYC host
class as the serial baselines, the 8-vCPU contribution ran on a separate role
machine through `relay participate` (66m37s of CPU in 8m01s of wall clock),
and verification ran through the coordinator accept path (67m00s of CPU in
5m46s). The serial baselines are the corresponding stages of the completed
single-host K=21 production-mode run measured before these patches.

## 1. Parallel Phase 1 Point Updates

Each Phase 1 contribution updates millions of SRS points using fresh secret
scalars tau-prime, alpha-prime, and beta-prime. At index `i`, the work is
conceptually:

```text
Tau[i]      = Tau[i]      * tau-prime^i
AlphaTau[i] = AlphaTau[i] * alpha-prime * tau-prime^i
BetaTau[i]  = BetaTau[i]  * beta-prime  * tau-prime^i
```

### Previous behavior

One thread walked every index in sequence. It maintained one running power of
tau-prime and performed all G1 and G2 scalar multiplications serially.

### Parallel behavior

The updated implementation divides the arrays into disjoint ranges. Each
worker:

1. Computes `tau-prime^start` for the first index in its range.
2. Updates only the points in that range.
3. Advances its own local power of tau-prime after each point.

The expensive first range, which updates G1 Tau, G2 Tau, AlphaTau, and
BetaTau, is scheduled separately from the lighter G1-Tau-only tail. This
prevents the lighter tail from distorting load balancing for the four-operation
range.

```text
worker 0: [start 0 ................................ end 0)
worker 1:                         [start 1 ........ end 1)
worker 2:                                            [start 2 ... end 2)
```

### Correctness and race safety

- Worker ranges never overlap.
- Each worker owns its field elements and `big.Int` temporaries.
- Every index receives the same scalar as in the original serial loop.
- Alpha, beta, and the index-zero values retain their original handling.
- Equivalence tests compare the complete parallel SRS with the retained serial
  reference implementation.
- The Go race detector passes for the patched package.

## 2. Parallel Phase 1 Encoding and Decoding

An exact K=21 Phase 1 artifact is approximately 576 MiB and contains millions
of compressed G1 and G2 points.

### Previous behavior

Gnark constructed a large `[]any` containing an individual reference to every
point. Its generic encoder or decoder then processed those references one at a
time. Point decompression, curve checks, and subgroup checks therefore ran
serially.

### Parallel behavior

The new codec processes bounded chunks of 4,096 points.

Encoding:

```text
compress each point concurrently into its fixed byte offset
                              |
                              v
write the completed chunk in canonical point order
```

Decoding:

```text
read one fixed-width canonical chunk in point order
                              |
                              v
decode and validate each point concurrently
```

Chunks themselves are always read and written sequentially, so scheduling
cannot reorder artifact bytes.

### Wire format and validation

The encoded layout remains:

```text
N
G2 Beta
G1 Tau[1:]
G2 Tau[1:]
G1 BetaTau
G1 AlphaTau
```

Every decoded point still undergoes:

- canonical field-element decoding;
- curve membership validation;
- subgroup validation; and
- deterministic error selection in point order.

The new reader consumes fixed compressed widths and therefore rejects
uncompressed encodings that gnark's generic decoder previously could consume.
This is intentional for proof-tool's strict canonical-artifact boundary, but it
is a behavior change in the patched gnark `SrsCommons.ReadFrom` method and must
remain explicitly documented and tested.

Temporary codec memory is bounded by one chunk rather than scaling with the
number of SRS point references.

## 3. Parallel Phase 2 Initialization

Phase 2 derives circuit-specific Groth16 parameters from the sealed Phase 1 SRS
and the compiled R1CS. The optimization covers three areas.

### 3.1 Lagrange group FFTs

Initialization computes four large group transforms:

- Tau in G1;
- Tau in G2;
- AlphaTau in G1; and
- BetaTau in G1.

Gnark's previous recursive FFT split its two recursive halves across workers,
but each recursion node first completed a large butterfly pass serially. The
largest top-level pass therefore delayed all recursive parallelism.

The new implementation parallelizes the butterfly pass itself under a fixed
CPU budget:

```text
stage 0:  1 branch  x 16 workers
stage 1:  2 branches x 8 workers
stage 2:  4 branches x 4 workers
stage 3:  8 branches x 2 workers
stage 4: 16 branches x 1 worker
```

Each butterfly operates on a distinct pair of points. No two workers write the
same point during a stage, and the total intended concurrency remains bounded
by the selected worker budget.

### 3.2 Constraint accumulation

Each R1CS constraint contributes to A, B, and C evaluations associated with
particular wires. Parallelizing constraints directly would allow multiple
workers to mutate the same wire.

The implementation instead:

1. Reads constraints sequentially in bounded batches of 16,384.
2. Assigns each wire to exactly one worker using `wireID % workerCount`.
3. Queues left, right, and output terms for the owning worker.
4. Processes those queues concurrently.
5. Completes the batch before reading the next one.

Terms for a particular wire and expression side retain their original order.
Because a wire has exactly one owner, no locks are required and workers cannot
race on the output arrays.

### 3.3 Independent point loops

Two additional loops operate on independent output points and are now
parallel:

- construction of the Z polynomial points; and
- computation of `beta*A + alpha*B + C` for every wire.

## Security and Determinism Invariants

The optimizations are designed around the following invariants:

- Transcript and SRS bytes must not depend on goroutine scheduling.
- Workers may read shared immutable data but must own every point they mutate.
- Point decoding must retain canonical, curve, and subgroup validation.
- Additional memory must remain bounded at K=21.
- The pinned gnark version and all local patches must be represented in build
  provenance and SBOM evidence.
- Serial and parallel implementations must produce byte-identical outputs for
  deterministic fixtures.

Focused equivalence and negative tests, the race detector, ceremony integration
tests, and vendor regeneration/drift checks pass.

The equivalence fixtures use deterministic, distinct curve points. The Phase 2
test compares both one- and four-worker execution with a retained copy of
gnark v0.15.0's serial initialization algorithm, including its serial group
FFTs. It also asserts that the fixture's inverse FFT is dense, preventing a
constant-vector delta from making most accumulation operations no-ops. The
codec test crosses the 4,096-point chunk boundary with a different point at
every serialized position, and a negative test records the intentional
rejection of otherwise valid uncompressed Phase 1 points.

## Remaining Review Follow-up

Execute FFT butterfly loops directly when a recursion node has only one
assigned task, avoiding unnecessary one-worker goroutine creation. This is a
small scheduling cleanup rather than a correctness requirement.

The full exact K=21 comparison rehearsal remains the final performance and
coherence check. Its ceremony binary is pinned independently by SHA-256, and
its measurements record wall time, CPU time, peak memory, filesystem activity,
and exact command outputs for every stage.
