# Regenerates vendor/ from go.mod and applies the reviewed browser-prover patches
# (gnark ProveStream/MSM seam, opt-W2 domain decoding, opt-W3 CCS release, and
# opt-W1 dispatch-before-FFT scheduling/yields, opt-W6 scoped computeH
# coset-table reuse, opt-C8 constant byte-operation folding, and the native
# MPC ceremony Phase 1/Phase 2 parallel hot paths).
# vendor/ is
# gitignored; this script is the ONLY supported way to (re)create it.
# A plain `go mod vendor` produces a tree WITHOUT the streaming prover and
# the build will fail — run this instead.
#
# Refuses to clobber a drifted tree: if vendor/ exists and does not match
# `go mod vendor` + patches, it aborts so unmirrored optimization work is not
# lost. Use scripts/check-vendor-drift.sh to inspect.
